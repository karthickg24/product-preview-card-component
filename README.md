## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have written CSS in BEM methodology. I m still learning it. I also implemented style in grid system. 

***I also learned...***

- ... that applying `box-radius` in container of image doesn't apply the box-radius to image. image will override style from parent. To make images inherit the styles, i used
`box-radius: inherit` in image
- ... about `.visually-hidden`, how it helps screen-headers to read content, yet content is hidden from displaying

### Continued development

I want to learn and continue writing CSS in BEM methodology and understand how I can make my websites as accessible as possible.

### Useful resources

- [How to: Hide Content](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/) - This helped me to know little about visually hidden class. Use the styles.
- [How to plan your HTML: Product Preview Card](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) - This article goes through the steps to complete this challenge with accessibility in mind.
